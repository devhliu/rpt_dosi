This is a draft project about a tentative toolkit for dosimetry in radionuclide therapy. 

This is used for estimating the absorbed dose from SPECT images in 177Lu therapy (both Neurendocrine tumors and prostate cancer with PSMA). 

Still work in progress. If interested, contact us. 

**WARNING** : required python >= 3.9 (not 3.8)
